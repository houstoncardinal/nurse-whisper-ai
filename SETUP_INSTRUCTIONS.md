# Raha - Setup Instructions for Real Functionality

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Your App is Currently in DEMO Mode

Your app **transcribes voice correctly** but **generates FAKE notes** because the OpenAI API is not configured. Here's how to make it fully functional:

---

## Phase 1 MVP - Making It Real (Not Demo)

### Step 1: Get an OpenAI API Key (REQUIRED)

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-...`)
5. **Cost**: ~$0.002 per note (very cheap with GPT-4o-mini)

### Step 2: Configure Your Environment

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` and add your OpenAI key:
```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
```

3. Restart your development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test the Full Workflow

1. **Start Recording**: Click the microphone button
2. **Speak**: Say something like:
   ```
   "Patient presents with chest pain, pain level 6 out of 10. 
   Vital signs: blood pressure 118 over 76, heart rate 88, 
   respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 98%, temperature 99.2 degrees. 
   Patient is alert and oriented times three, no acute distress."
   ```
3. **Stop Recording**: Click stop
4. **Wait for AI**: The app will now call OpenAI to generate a REAL professional note
5. **Review Draft**: Check the AI-generated content (not fake data)
6. **Export**: Copy to clipboard or download

## What's Currently Working vs. What's Broken

### ✅ Working (Demo Mode):
- Voice transcription (Web Speech API)
- Template selection (SOAP, SBAR, PIE, DAR)
- UI/UX and navigation
- Export functionality (copy/download)
- Mock note generation (fake data)

### ❌ Not Working (Needs API Key):
- **Real AI note generation** - Currently shows fake/mock data
- **ICD-10 suggestions** - Uses basic pattern matching instead of AI
- **Clinical reasoning** - No actual medical intelligence
- **Quality assessment** - Fake confidence scores

---

## Current Code Flow (What Happens Now)

### Without API Key (DEMO MODE):
```
Voice Input → Transcription ✓
    ↓
AI Service Called → API Key Missing ❌
    ↓
Fallback to Mock Data → Shows Fake Note ❌
    ↓
Export Fake Note → Not Real Documentation ❌
```

### With API Key (REAL MODE):
```
Voice Input → Transcription ✓
    ↓
AI Service Called → OpenAI API ✓
    ↓
Real AI Generation → Professional Note ✓
    ↓
Export Real Note → Ready for EHR ✓
```

## Verification Checklist

After adding your API key, verify these work:

- [ ] Voice transcription captures your speech
- [ ] AI generates DIFFERENT content each time (not same fake data)
- [ ] Notes include specific details from your transcription
- [ ] ICD-10 codes are relevant to what you said
- [ ] Confidence scores change based on input quality
- [ ] Export contains real, usable documentation

---

## Cost Estimates (OpenAI API)

Using GPT-4o-mini (recommended):
- **Per Note**: ~$0.002 (less than a penny)
- **100 Notes**: ~$0.20
- **1,000 Notes**: ~$2.00
- **10,000 Notes**: ~$20.00

This is extremely affordable for professional use.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "AI service temporarily unavailable"
- Check your `.env` file has the correct API key
- Restart your dev server after adding the key
- Verify the key starts with `sk-`

### "Failed to generate note"
- Check your OpenAI account has credits
- Verify your API key is active
- Check browser console for error messages

### Notes still look fake/generic
- Make sure you restarted the server after adding the key
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check the console for "OpenAI API key not found" warnings

## Next Steps After Setup

Once your API key is configured:

1. **Test thoroughly** with different medical scenarios
2. **Verify accuracy** of generated notes
3. **Adjust templates** if needed for your specialty
4. **Train your team** on proper voice input
5. **Monitor API costs** in OpenAI dashboard

---

## Phase 2+ Features (Already Built, Need Testing)

These features are coded but need real API to work properly:
- ICD-10 auto-suggestions with AI reasoning
- Smart templates for different specialties
- Clinical decision support
- Quality scoring and validation
- Medical terminology optimization

---

## Support

If you need help:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify your `.env` file is in the project root
3. Ensure the API key is valid and has credits
4. Test with a simple voice input first

---

## Security Notes

- **Never commit** your `.env` file to git (it's in `.gitignore`)
- **Never share** your OpenAI API key publicly
- **Rotate keys** regularly for security
- **Monitor usage** to prevent unexpected charges
- **Use environment variables** in production (not hardcoded keys)

---

## Summary

**Your app works for transcription, but generates fake notes without an OpenAI API key.**

To make it real:
1. Get OpenAI API key
2. Add to `.env` file
3. Restart server
4. Test with real voice input

That's it! The code is already built to handle everything else.
